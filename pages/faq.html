				<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Choosing your starting 11</b><br><br>&emsp;From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek deadline to form your team.<br><br>&emsp;All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may &emsp;be automatically substituted. <br><br> &emsp;Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selected at all times. <br></p>
				<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Selecting a Captain and a Vice-Captain</b><br><br>&emsp;From your starting 11 you nominate a captain and a vice-captain. Your captain's score will be doubled.<br><br>&emsp;If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, the captain will be changed to the vice-captain.<br><br>&emsp;If both captain and vice-captain play 0 minutes in a Gameweek, then no player's score will be doubled.<br> </p>
				<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions</b><br><br>&emsp;Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries and postponements by automatically replacing &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starting players who don't play in a Gameweek.<br><br>&emsp;Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:<br></p>
				<ul class = "c1">
					<li >If your Goalkeeper plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, he will be substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the Gameweek.</li>
					<li>If any of your outfield players play 0 minutes in the Gameweek, they will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute who played in the Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only be replaced by another defender).</li>

    			<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Clean Sheets</b><br><br>&emsp;A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch and playing at least 60 minutes.<br><br>&emsp;If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will not affect any clean sheet bonus.<br></p>
    			<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Red Cards</b><br><br>&emsp;If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised for goals conceded by their team.<br><br>&emsp;Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards<br></p>
    			<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Assists</b><br><br>&emsp;Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who makes the final pass before a goal is scored. An &emsp;assist is awarded whether the pass was intentional (that it actually creates the chance) or unintentional (that the &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;player had to dribble the ball or an inadvertent touch or shot created the chance).<br><br>&emsp;If an opposing player touches the ball after the final pass before a goal is scored, significantly altering the intended &emsp;destination of the ball, then no assist is awarded. Should two opposing players touch the ball after the final pass &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before a goal is scored, then no assist is awarded. If the goal scorer loses and then regains possession, then no assist &emsp;is awarded.<br></p>
    			<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Rebounds</b><br><br>&emsp;If a shot on goal is blocked by an opposition player, is saved by a goalkeeper or hits the woodwork, and a goal is &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scored from the rebound, then an assist is awarded.<br></p>
    			<p style = "font-size : 14pt;"><b>&emsp;Own Goals</b><br><br>&emsp;If a player shoots or passes the ball and forces an opposing player to put the ball in his own net, then an assist is awarded.<br></p>
    			<p style = "font-size : 15pt;"><b>&emsp;Penalties and Free-Kicks</b><br><br>&emsp;In the event of a penalty or free-kick, the player earning the penalty or free-kick is awarded an assist if a goal is &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly scored, but not if he takes it himself, in which case no assist is given.</p>
